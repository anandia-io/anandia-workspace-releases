# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how Tony Alfredsson AB ("we", "us", or "our"), operating under the brand name Anandia, handles information in connection with Anandia Workspace ("Software" or "Application").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect (and don't collect), how we use it, and your rights.

## 1. Overview

**Anandia Workspace is a local-first application.** This means:

- Your data is stored on your device
- We do not have access to your content
- We do not collect, transmit, or sell your personal information
- You have complete control over your data

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect

We do NOT collect:

- Your notes, tasks, projects, or any content you create
- Personal identification information (name, email, address)
- Device identifiers or hardware information
- Location data
- Browsing history or usage patterns
- Keystrokes or screen content
- Contact lists or calendar data

## 3. Information We May Collect

### 3.1 Update Checks

When the application checks for updates, minimal technical information may be exchanged:

- Current application version
- Operating system type (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- System architecture (x64, ARM64)

This information is used solely to provide the correct update for your system and is not stored or associated with any identifier.

### 3.2 Anonymous Telemetry (Opt-In)

You can choose to enable anonymous telemetry in Settings > Advanced > Privacy. This is **disabled by default** and requires your explicit consent.

If you enable telemetry, we may collect:

- **Usage patterns**: Which features you use and how often
- **Performance metrics**: App startup time, response times
- **Error events**: Non-sensitive error codes and frequencies
- **Session data**: Session duration, feature navigation
- **System info**: OS version, app version, display resolution

Telemetry data:
- Is completely anonymous (no user identifiers)
- Does NOT include any of your content (notes, tasks, projects, etc.)
- Does NOT include personal information
- Is sent to Anandia's analytics service
- Helps us understand how to improve the application
- Can be disabled at any time in Settings

### 3.3 Future Cloud Features

If we introduce cloud synchronization in the future:

- Additional privacy terms will be provided before activation
- Cloud features will be explicitly opt-in
- You will control what data is synchronized
- Data in transit will be encrypted

## 4. Local Data Storage

### 4.1 What Is Stored

Anandia Workspace stores the following on your device:

### 4.2 Storage Location

Data is stored in your system's standard application data directory:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\io.anandia.workspace\`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/io.anandia.workspace/`

### 4.3 Database

Your content is stored in a SQLite database file. This file:

## 5. Third-Party Services

### 5.1 GitHub

We use GitHub for:
- Application distribution (releases)

When checking for updates, your device connects to GitHub's servers. GitHub's privacy policy applies to these connections: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies

### 5.2 Anandia Analytics (Opt-In Only)

If you enable telemetry, anonymous usage data is sent to Anandia's own analytics service. We do NOT use third-party analytics services like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Amplitude.

Our analytics service:
- Is operated by Anandia
- Receives only anonymous, aggregated data
- Does not track individual users
- Does not correlate data with personal identifiers

### 5.3 No Advertising

We do NOT:
- Display advertisements
- Share data with advertisers
- Track you for advertising purposes

## 6. Data Security

Your data security depends on your device security:

- Use strong device passwords
- Enable disk encryption (BitLocker, FileVault, LUKS)
- Keep your operating system updated
- Use antivirus software

### 6.2 Our Responsibility

Since we don't collect or store your data, we cannot:
- Experience data breaches affecting your content
- Lose your data
- Have our servers compromised with your information

### 6.3 Your Responsibility

You are responsible for:
- Backing up your data
- Securing your device
- Any data loss due to device failure

## 7. Children's Privacy

Anandia Workspace is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with information, please contact us.

## 8. Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

### 8.1 Access
Your data is stored locally - you can access it anytime through the application or by directly accessing the database files.

### 8.2 Portability
You can export your data or copy the database files.

### 8.3 Deletion
Uninstalling the application and deleting the data directory removes all data.

### 8.4 Modification

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect:
- New features (especially cloud features)
- Legal requirements
- Improved privacy practices

Changes will be communicated through:
- Application update notes
- Our website

Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

## 10. Data Retention

### 10.1 Local Data
Data remains on your device until you delete it. We have no access to it.

### 10.2 Crash Reports
If you opt into crash reporting, reports are retained only as long as needed for debugging (typically 90 days).
